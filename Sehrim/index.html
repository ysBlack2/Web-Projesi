            <h3>Gaza Strip</h3>
            <p>Gaza is one of the oldest and biggest Palestinian cities and it goes back to 3000 BC. It is considered Palestine’s second capital and it holds around 60% of the Palestinian population, making it a block of the Palestinian soul. Its strategic geographical location has made it the target of, failure, colonialism.</p>
            <p>Gaza isn’t nicknamed “Gaza Al-Izza” - Gaza of Pride - for nothing. Its strategic geographical location and vast reputation in spite of its size has made it the target of the eyes of colonialism. Gaza was able to stand up for itself and call every colonialist a failure. Our pride to our mother land makes us feel connected with a supreme purpose of life.</p>

            <p>Other noteworthy beach locations are Beach No. 9, which boasts breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea, and Al-Saraya Beach, a well-liked and lively meeting spot for locals. Though these beaches have received high marks, whenever you visit any area of the Gaza Strip, you should also take safety considerations and travel advice into account.</p>

            <h3>The Great Mosque</h3>
            <p>The Great Mosque of Gaza, also known as the Great Omari Mosque, was the largest and oldest mosque in the Gaza Strip, Palestine, located in Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Believed to stand on the site of an ancient Philistine temple, the site was used by the Byzantines to erect a church in the 5th century. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, it was transformed into a mosque. Described as "beautiful" by Ibn Battuta, the Great Mosque's minaret was toppled in an earthquake in 1033. In 1149, the Crusaders built a large church. It was mostly destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1187, and then rebuilt as a mosque by the Mamluks in the early 13th century.</p>
